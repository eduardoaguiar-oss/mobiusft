1. INTRODUCTION
The Mobius Forensic Toolkit is a comprehensive, open-source forensic toolkit
and framework that has been developed using C++ and Python. It is designed to
handle cases and case items, and offers a flexible interface for creating
extensions. The toolkit uses SQLite databases for data storage, making it
easy to integrate with other forensic tools. It is capable of working with
both image files (such as raw, split, ewf, talon, solo, dossier, msr, vhd
and vhdx) and physical devices as sources of input.
